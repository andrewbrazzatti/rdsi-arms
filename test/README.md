# Testing ARMS

## Overview

ARMS is a Web browser application for use by people and some APIs for
use by other computer programs.

The current test plan focuses on testing of the Web browser
application. The test plan is currently incomplete and additional
tests need to be created to test other functionality in the Web
browser application that are not yet being tested, as well as tests
for the APIs.

## Test plan

### Updating the test plan

The test plan is written in _Markdown_ and uses `**Test**:` to
identify tests, and `**Check**:` to identify checks. Numbers can
appear after the keywoard and before the trailing double-asterisks.

The tests and checks can be renumbered by running:

    make update

That command will also update the version date.
