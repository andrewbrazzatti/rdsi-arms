##redbox using puppet : serverless
__________________________

## use pre-install.sh to setup puppet for redbox use.

## With DNS and SSL in place:
puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':}"

## If DNS is not setup:
puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':
	has_dns => false,
}"

## To install without SSL:
puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':
	ssl_files => false
}"

## NB : for default values of ssl_files, presumes that you have the following certificates already installed:
## ssl_cert   => "/etc/ssl/local_certs/SSLCertificateFile/${::fqdn}.crt",
## ssl_key    => "/etc/ssl/local_certs/SSLCertificateKeyFile/${::fqdn}.key",
## ssl_chain  => "/etc/ssl/local_certs/SSLCertificateChainFile/${::fqdn}_CA.crt",

## TODD : set up using r10k
## TODO : use gpg pattern for handling SSL certs and keys
