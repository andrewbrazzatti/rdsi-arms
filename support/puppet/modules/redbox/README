redbox

This is the redbox module.
After installing puppet, redbox needs to be copied to the module path on the OS.
Enter: 
sudo -s (until we have a dedicated puppet user, run all below as su)

puppet config print modulepath 

to find where to install the redbox module. Copy redbox to the module path.
Once redbox is in the module path, to apply it:

puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':}"
