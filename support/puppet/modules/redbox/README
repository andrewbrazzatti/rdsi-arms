##redbox using puppet : serverless
__________________________
## The module deploys, installs and runs redbox.

## use scripts/pre-install.sh to setup puppet for redbox use.

## With DNS and SSL in place:
puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':}"

## If DNS is not setup:
puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':
	has_dns => false,
}"

## To install without SSL:
puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':
	has_ssl => false,
}"

## NB : for default values of ssl_files, ls presumes that you have the following certificates already installed:
## cert   => "/etc/ssl/local_certs/SSLCertificateFile/${::fqdn}.crt",
## key    => "/etc/ssl/local_certs/SSLCertificateKeyFile/${::fqdn}.key",
## chain  => "/etc/ssl/local_certs/SSLCertificateChainFile/${::fqdn}_CA.crt",
## to change the pathnames
puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':
	$ssl_files = {
		cert => "...",
		key  => "...",
		chain => "...",
	},
}


## No support to run without apache proxy server.
## Tested only on CentOS
## TODD : set up using r10k
## TODO : use gpg pattern for handling SSL certs and keys
