##redbox using puppet : serverless
__________________________
## The module deploys, installs and runs redbox.

## use scripts/pre-install.sh to setup puppet for redbox use.
## requires public key added to private bitbucket repository for hiera configuration

puppet apply -e "class {'redbox':}"

## atm, there is still work to be done on our rpms and puppet use.
## For now, after running puppet command,above, run 
`yum update redbox-rdsi-arms-<<node-name>>`

## Until we have gpg-hiera pattern setup for use with sensitive data, the following needs manual setup:
## - ssl certificates and keys, including their directories
## - aaf rapid setup in home/system-config.json

## No support to run without apache proxy server.
## Tested only on CentOS
## TODD : set up using r10k
## TODO : use gpg pattern for handling SSL certs and keys
