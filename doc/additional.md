# Additional documentation

## ReDBox documentation

The ARMS system is based on ReDBox and a lot of useful documentation
for the system can be found at
<http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/documentation>. Key
documentation items include:

* System layout: <http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/documentation/system-administration/general-administration/system-layout>
* Branding: <http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/documentation/system-administration/general-administration/branding>
* The workflow and forms configuration: <http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/documentation/how-to/setup-a-new-workflow>
* In-depth info about the configuration file: <https://sites.google.com/site/fascinatorhome/home/documentation/technical/configuration>

ARMS provides a notifications system that can send emails at various
times. This has not yet been configured for QCIF but the documentation
should assist those wishing to enable notifications:
