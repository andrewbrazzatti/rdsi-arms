# Deploying ARMS

## Installation options

There are many methods for deploying ARMS. Here are a few common methods.

- [Deploy pre-built components from the  Nexus repository](deploy-nexus.md)
: Download ARMS ReDBox and Mint as pre-built components from QCIF's
  Nexus repository.
  This is useful for quick testing of ARMS.

[Build from source code and then deploy](deploy-source.md)
: Build an ARMS ReDBox installer from the sources. Download Mint as a
  pre-built component from QCIF's Nexus repository.
  This is useful for creating and testing custom builds of ARMS.

- [Puppet deployment](deploy-puppet.md)
: Use the Puppet configuration management tool to automate deployment
  and configuration of ARMS. The supplied Puppet scripts configure
  ReDBox and Shibboleth (for AAF authentication).
  This is useful for automated production deployment of ARMS.
