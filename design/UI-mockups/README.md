ARMS UI mockups
===============

Introduction
------------

This directory contains user interface mockups for ARMS.

Organisation of the mockups
---------------------------

The **ARMS-login** is the root page of the mockups. Start exploring
the mockups from this page.

There are links from the _ARMS-login_ page to each of the four
dashboard pages. Each of those four dashboard pages has a _logout_
link (at the top right) that goes back to the _ARMS-login_ page.

On every dashboard page, the _edit_ icons are linked to one of the
form pages. On every form page, the _save and close_ button goes
back to a dashboard. In actual operation it will go to the current
role's dashboard, but in the mockup it goes to the dashboard of the
role that is able to edit that particular page (e.g. the outcome page
goes to the reviewer's dashboard page). The _new request_ button in
the requestor's dashboard also goes to the first form page.
